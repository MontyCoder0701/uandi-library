## About This Library

- UandI components are made with Material CDK and Tailwind.
- They are intended to be used for Angular.
- Atomic Design is the main core idea for this library.

## About the Design

- Design is to be accessible, with minimal colors.
- The design is to be integrated with any system, so should be simple and versatile.

## Used Icons

- Icons that are to be used (for suffixIcon or prefixIcon) should be from the [Material Symbols / Icons library](https://fonts.google.com/icons).
- Other icons will not work.
